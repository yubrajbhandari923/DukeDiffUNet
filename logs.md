Running the Basic DDP code on plp-capri.

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,4,5,6 OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 nohup torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 -m train.segdiff_1_0 \
  --exp_config /home/yb107/cvpr2025/DukeDiffSeg/configs/experiments/segdiff.yaml > /home/yb107/logs/train_segdiff.log 2>&1 &
  (Because 1,2 GPU are running in capri for some reason)
  
- Look at `tail -f /home/yb107/logs/train_segdiff.log`
- To kill the nohup process: `ps aux | grep train.segdiff_1_0` then `kill -9 $pid`
OR `ps aux | grep torchrun`

For some reason rank 0 seems not to be working.

Medsegdiff ran for 200 epochs. need to fix eval code to make it run quickly.

Tried running inference on the trained code. Prediction was all zeros. Need to dig into the actual diffsion code base.

Meeting Notes:
Why this method? 
- Porbably is better (especially in the hard cases like diseased liver/organs or tumors). Can prove this by running on the quality control failed cases of Dukeseg
- Uncertainity based method
-
